This phenomenon, known as 'time dilation,' occurs because our brains process familiar information more quickly than novel information. When we're engaged in new experiences, we form more detailed memories, making time seem to stretch. In routine situations, fewer details are recorded, so time seems to pass more quickly in retrospect."
