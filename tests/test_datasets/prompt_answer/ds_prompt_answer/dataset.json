    "answer": "The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It has two main components: the innate immune system (which provides immediate, general defense) and the adaptive immune system (which provides specific, targeted defense that improves with exposure). Key players include white blood cells, antibodies, lymph nodes, the spleen, and bone marrow.",
