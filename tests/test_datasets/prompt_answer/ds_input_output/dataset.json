ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory that permanently stores instructions for the computer's startup process and basic operations. It retains data even when the computer is turned off.",

    "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is captured by chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. In the Calvin cycle, this energy is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.",
