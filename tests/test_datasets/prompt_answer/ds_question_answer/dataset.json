    "question": "How do vaccines work to protect against infectious diseases?",
    "answer": "Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. They contain either weakened or inactivated parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. This creates antibodies that allow the immune system to fight that disease quickly should it appear in the future.",
